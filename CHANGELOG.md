# Changelog

All notable changes to aizk are documented here.

The format follows Keep a Changelog, and releases are cut from the version in `pyproject.toml`.

## Unreleased

### Security

- Closed an RLS write-policy bypass: an empty scope set made `scopes <@ writer_groups` trivially
  true, so any authenticated caller could write into another user's private space. The empty-scope
  write branch is now guarded on ownership, re-applied to the live schema by migration `0003`.
- Gated curated-group pending facts out of the default recall SQL and re-stamped `reviewed_at` on
  document moves, so a member never recalls another's unreviewed facts and a move cannot smuggle
  unreviewed content into a curated canon.
- A malformed identity-provider groups claim is skipped rather than crashing every authenticated
  request the token makes.

### Fixed

- Retrieval: gap-fill truncates to the requested `k`, rerank guards a score-count mismatch, and a
  pagerank non-convergence degrades instead of failing the whole recall.
- Extraction: consolidation checks every same-predicate claim, a non-UTF-8 file no longer aborts a
  directory ingest, and the community/RAPTOR growth watermark stays monotonic under decay.
- The GLiNER2 relevance gate is re-enabled on the classification head with a `Person` floor and
  loads offline from a persistent cache; structural kinds no longer leak into the auto-create pool.

### Changed

- Store operations read the open session from a task-local `session()` accessor bound by
  `acting_as`/`admin_session`, rather than threading a `session` parameter through every call.
- Client-generated ids use uuid7 for index locality, and the server image caches its dependency
  layer so a source edit rebuilds in seconds instead of re-resolving every wheel.

## 0.0.1 - 2026-07-04

### Added

- The content and claim store, entities and facts split into immutable content rows plus
  per-container bi-temporal claims, so identical knowledge extracted twice never duplicates.
- The scope-set lattice, `scopes uuid[]` on every row, forced Postgres row level security
  compiled from the models, and implicit intersection scopes for groups with no standing group
  of their own.
- The write path, chunking, a GLiNER2 gate, one combined extraction call, and a rules-first
  consolidation cascade, averaging 1.22 LLM calls per chunk.
- The read path, `recall()` fusing dense, lexical, graph-neighbor, community, RAPTOR, and
  profile lanes behind one hybrid Postgres function plus a cross-encoder rerank.
- Autonomy, a pgqueuer-backed worker and cron scheduler driving graph build, session
  promotion, dedup, decay, communities, RAPTOR, profiles, insights, and curation review.
- 36 MCP tools over FastMCP, everyday memory verbs, group governance, and root-only
  maintenance and admin, with Zitadel or local API-key identity.
- The eval harness, hit@k/nDCG@k/MRR scoring, a config sweep, and EverMemBench/TEMPO dataset
  loaders gated behind `AIZK_BENCHMARKS_ENABLED`.
- Documentation at [phvv.me/aizk](https://phvv.me/aizk), the engine explained in five parts,
  a paper-by-paper provenance map, and measured benchmarks and comparisons.
